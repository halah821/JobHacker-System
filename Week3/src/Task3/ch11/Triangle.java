package Task3;
//(The Triangle class) Design a class named Triangle that extends
//        GeometricObject.
//        The class contains:
//        ■■ Three double data fields named side1, side2, and side3 with default values
//        1.0 to denote three sides of a triangle.
//        ■■ A no-arg constructor that creates a default triangle.
//        ■■ A constructor that creates a triangle with the specified side1, side2, and side3.
//        ■■ The accessor methods for all three data fields.
//        ■■ A method named getArea() that returns the area of this triangle.
//        ■■ A method named getPerimeter() that returns the perimeter of this triangle.
//        ■■ A method named toString() that returns a string description for the triangle.
//        For the formula to compute the area of a triangle, see Programming Exercise 2.19.
//        The toString() method is implemented as follows:
//        return "Triangle: side1 = " + side1 + " side2 = " + side2 +
//        " side3 = " + side3;
//        Draw the UML diagrams for the classes Triangle and GeometricObject and
//        implement the classes. Write a test program that prompts the user to enter three
//        sides of the triangle, a color, and a Boolean value to indicate whether the triangle
//        is filled. The program should create a Triangle object with these sides and set
//        the color and filled properties using the input. The program should display
//        the area, perimeter, color, and true or false to indicate whether it is filled or not.
