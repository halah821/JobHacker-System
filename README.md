Please Study String Topic https://www.javatpoint.com/java-string,
And this week, there are no more materials, and everything will be based on the old ones plus String so we can master what we've learned before. However, there will be a new tasks to solve.
Task1: Reverse a String: Write a program that takes a String input from the user and prints out the reverse of that string.
Task2: Check if a String is a Palindrome: Write a program that takes a String input from the user and checks if it is a Palindrome (a word or phrase that reads the same backward as forward).
Task3: OOP-Task https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TrZxPaMaJB9fpfW0dy5q92hJwnwWyhlL7-LBz0PhlQA/edit?usp=sharing
Bonus
Task3: write a program that print the number of occurrences of the given word in the string.
1- Perform the above task using only methods of the String class (Using 2 ways).
2- Perform the above task using StringTokenizer class.

Tasks

Task 1:
( InputMismatchException ) Write a program that prompts the user to read
two integers and displays their sum. Your program should prompt the user to
read the number again if the input is incorrect.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Task 2:
(Count words) Write a program that counts the number of words in the file
Task instructions:
Make a file named Lincoln.txt
Copy the text on this url and paste it to the file
Print the number of the words inside the file.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Task 3:
(Calculate the sum and average from a file) Suppose the text file on the Web
http://liveexample.pearsoncmg.com/data/Scores.txt contains an unspecified number of scores separated by spaces. Write a program that reads the scores from the internet and store them into the file. Then , calculate the sum and average of these values.
Task instructions:
         - Make a file named Scores.txt
         - Read the values in the url and store it inside the file
         - Make a function that reads the values from the file and print the sum and average of the values inside the file.
Code Structure:
         - Make a function(readFromWebToFile) that will take a url and return a file. This method will read the data from the url and store it into the file named Scores.txt
         - Make a function(getSum) that will take a file and return an integer value representing the sum of the values inside the file.
         - Make a function (getAverage) that will take a file and return an integer value representing the average of the values inside the file.
