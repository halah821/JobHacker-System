**Tasks**

 **Task 1:**  
( InputMismatchException ) Write a program that prompts the user to read  
two integers and displays their sum. Your program should prompt the user to  
read the number again if the input is incorrect.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
**Task 2:**  
(Count words) Write a program that counts the number of words in the file  
Task instructions:  
use this  [input file](https://liveexample.pearsoncmg.com/data/Lincoln.txt)  
Make a file named Lincoln.txt  
Copy the text on this url and paste it to the file  
Print the number of the words inside the file.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
**Task 3:**  
(Calculate the sum and average from a file) Suppose the text file on the Web  
[http://liveexample.pearsoncmg.com/data/Scores.txt](http://liveexample.pearsoncmg.com/data/Scores.txt)  contains an unspecified number of scores separated by spaces. Write a program that reads the scores from the internet and store them into the file. Then , calculate the sum and average of these values.Task instructions:  
- Make a file named Scores.txt  
- Read the values in the url and store it inside the file  
- Make a function that reads the values from the file and print the sum and average of the values inside the file.  
Code Structure:  
- Make a function(readFromWebToFile) that will take a url and return a file. This method will read the data from the url and store it into the file named Scores.txt  
- Make a function(getSum) that will take a file and return an integer value representing the sum of the values inside the file.  
 - Make a function (getAverage) that will take a file and return an integer value representing the average of the values inside the file.



## week6
In response to your request, we confirm that there are no new resources for Week 6. However,
